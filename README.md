Are you wasting a lot of time looking through UBC PAIRS to decide on a GPA booster in a specific department or for a specific year level? As students, we know that your time is valuable and you would rather spend those precious hours studying, grinding LeetCode or scrolling through Reddit to upvote all the memes on natural recursion Introducing UBC Course & Rec, the app that can help you make your transcript desirable in the eyes of employers (weâ€™re looking at you, FAANG) and grad schools by making course hunting for classes with high historical averages hassle free. Simply enter in a subject code and the threshold for the average you want and just let UBC Course & Rec do the hard work for you. For even higher accuracy, you (the user) can decide on the range of years you would like the average to be calculated over since some courses change their content frequently. Those with more flexibility can also take a more general approach by filtering by faculty or number of credits desired.
